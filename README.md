Hello, my name is Mikhail Kozlov and I am an active engineer for automatic control systems.

I work at an enterprise in the nuclear industry. In my main job, I am engaged in setting up and programming industrial logic controllers 
(Siemens, Panasonic, ADAM, Owen, etc.), and related technological equipment. 

Additionally, I am engaged in the development and prototyping of projects based on AVR, ARM microcontrollers. 
And also recently I have been developing software for PC in C# using the ".Net" Frameworks. 

I suggest trying to use my ASCADA project for home automation dispatching for any MCU.
